## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Olympic Qualification Math
**Path to LA 2028:**

### 2. Research-Validated Performance Indicators

**Match Outcome Predictors (84% accuracy):**
1. **Round 2 Performance** (strongest predictor)
2. Turning kicks (4-5 points) - exclusive to winners
3. Attack efficiency: 50.9% attack, 27.7% defense, 21.3% block
4. Lower BMI + dynamic strength

**Training Implication:**
Focus explosive Round 2 scoring in all training camps

### 3. Weight Category Strategy

**Olympic Categories (Only 8 total):**

**Women:**
- W-49kg: **Dunya Abutaleb** (PROVEN)
- W-57kg: Development target
- W-67kg: Lower competition density
- W+67kg: Lower competition density

**Men:**
- M-58kg: Development target
- M-68kg: High competition (avoid unless exceptional)
- M-80kg: Development target
- M+80kg: Lower competition density (OPPORTUNITY)

**Strategic Focus:**

## MEDAL OPPORTUNITY FORMULA

**Custom Algorithm (0-100 Score):**

Medal Opportunity Score = (Rank Score x 0.60) + (Competition Density x 0.30) + (Form Score x 0.10)

Where:
- Rank Score = max(0, 100 - (rank x 4))
- Competition Density = 1.0 - (top8_athletes / 20)
- Form Score = (wins_last_6mo / matches_last_6mo) x 100

**Interpretation:**
- 85-100: **CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY** (immediate action)
- 75-84: **HIGH OPPORTUNITY** (prioritize resources)
- 60-74: **MEDIUM OPPORTUNITY** (monitor closely)
- <60: **DEVELOPMENT** (long-term investment)
